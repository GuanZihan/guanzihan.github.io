I am a first year Ph.D. student in [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Anil Vullikanti](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/anil-vullikanti). Prior to that, I obtained my master degree in [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I worked with Prof. [Alessio](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.lomuscio) and Dr. [Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io), and I obtained my bachelor degree in [Dalian University of Technology](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/), where I worked with Prof. [Xuewen Huang](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2006011040/zh_CN/index.htm)


## Research Interests
I am broadly interested in Machine Learning Security, Privacy, Trustworthy AI, and Optimization.

I am currently learning [differential privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf). Welcome to have any discussions if you are also interested in this field.
